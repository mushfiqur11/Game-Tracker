This software keeps track of a cricket match. 
The live scorecard of the match is available to anyone in the same network.
The information of every match will be stored in a database with ball-to-ball details. In any later time, this information can be retrieved to know the statistics.

We have divided the workload into following parts:

Game-operator end software(with GUI)

Game-viewer end software(with GUI)

Connection with Database

Networking
